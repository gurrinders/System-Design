# System Design: Concepts and Resources

This repository contains key concepts and resources related to system design. Below is a curated list of topics, each accompanied by a helpful reference link for deeper understanding.

## 1. Performance Metrics
- **Latency vs Throughput**: 
  - **Latency**: Measures delay in network communication (time taken for data transfer). High latency indicates longer delays, while low latency indicates quicker response times.
  - **Throughput**: Measures the volume of data successfully transmitted over a network in a specific time period. It reflects data packet delivery success and loss.
